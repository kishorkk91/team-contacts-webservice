#This project describes about company team contacts restful webservices using Spring-Boot approach

- Java-script, CSS front-end approach
- Use of GET,POST,DELETE methods
- Exception, Generic exception handling
- Connecting RESTful services to JPA(entity, Relationships among tables)
- Proper use of validation
- h2-in memory database
- Dependency added to restart or build spring boot automatically whenever any change occurs
- Postman collection

# important to notice
- H2 in memory data base
- JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
- localhost:8080/h2-console

#To access GUI page and Swagger documentation for nice visual representation
- http://localhost:8080
- localhost:8080/v2/api-docs
- localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

# Why Microservices?

- Best practices of RESTful web services

- Consumer first, they should understand resources(Web-services)
- Best documentation
- Best use of Methods(GET, POST) and appropriate Status(201 CREATED instead of 200) to return

- Microservice architecture
- Independent of technology and communicate with each other
- Dynamic scaling
- Faster release cycle

# Task from Computa Center

Inspire us with clean source code and a well thought-out architecture! 
Task:
usecase: 
A software solution is to be created that manages the contacts of a team.   

Data Model:
Attributes: first name, last name, email address

Optional:
Define other meaningful attributes / entities and model a small database model  
A web application must be created for this

Entry page:  
Overview of previously created contacts (readonly)
Select a record and forward to the detail page  

Detail page for data record: 
Invest
To edit
Clear

optional:
Validation to a reasonable email address

delimitation: 
Login function not absolutely necessary

Technology: 
Multitier architecture
Database is freely selectable
part of the implementation should be Java-based
please make sensible use of components / frameworks of your choice
think about logging and error handling
 

The above-mentioned conditions represent rough framework conditions. In the area of ​​your technological home base, the topic can be implemented in more detail in order to represent your strengths.
